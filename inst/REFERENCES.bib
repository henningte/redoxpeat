 abstract = {Humic substances (HS) are heterogeneous, redox-active organic macromolecules. While electron transfer to and from HS under reducing conditions is well investigated, comparatively little is known on the electron donating (i.e., antioxidant) properties of HS under oxic conditions. In this work, the electron donating capacities (EDCs) of terrestrial and aquatic HS were quantified by mediated electrochemical oxidation over a wide range of pH values and applied redox potentials (E(h)) using 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) as an electron transfer mediator. Electrochemical oxidation of three model humic acids (HAs) was largely irreversible, and the EDCs of these HAs increased with increasing E(h) and pH. These results suggest that HS contain a wide variety of moieties that are oxidized at different potentials and that, upon oxidation, release protons and undergo irreversible follow-up reactions. At a given pH and E(h), the EDCs of the HS correlated well with their titrated phenol contents suggesting phenolic moieties as major electron donating groups in HS. Comparing the EDCs of 15 HS with their electron accepting capacities (EACs), aquatic HS had higher EDCs and lower EACs than terrestrial HS of comparable aromaticities. These results indicate that oxidative transformation of HS in the environment results in a depletion of electron donating phenolic moieties with antioxidant properties relative to the electron accepting quinone moieties.},

@article{Kim.2003,
 abstract = {Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is becoming an important tool in the study of natural organic matter (NOM) at the molecular level. Ultrahigh-resolution ESI-MS analyses of NOM often produce very complicated spectra; therefore, visual presentation and structural interpretations of the spectra are difficult. To meet this analytical challenge, we herein propose and demonstrate an approach using the van Krevelen diagram. With this approach, complicated mass spectra can be visualized in a way that allows for (1) possible reaction pathways to be identified and presented, and (2) qualitative analyses on major classes of compounds that comprise ultrahigh-resolution spectra. The qualitative analyses are in a good agreement with results obtained from analyses by other analytical techniques. Additionally, the van Krevelen diagram can be expanded to a 3D plot by using peak intensities or relative intensities as the z-axis. The 3D van Krevelen diagram allows for an evaluation of the relative significance of structurally related compounds. The 3D plot can also be a useful tool for compositional differentiation among samples.},

@article{Tan.2017,
 abstract = {The electron transfer capacities (ETCs) of soil humic substances (HSs) are linked to the type and abundance of redox-active functional moieties in their structure. Natural temperature can affect the chemical structure of natural organic matter by regulating their oxidative transformation and degradation in soil. However, it is unclear if there is a direct correlation between ETC of soil HS and mean annual temperature. In this study, we assess the response of the electron-accepting and -donating capacities (EAC and EDC) of soil HSs to temperature by analyzing HSs extracted from soil set along glacial-interglacial cycles through loess-palaeosol sequences and along natural temperature gradients through latitude and altitude transects. We show that the EAC and EDC of soil HSs increase and decrease, respectively, with increasing temperature. Increased temperature facilitates the prevalence of oxidative degradation and transformation of HS in soils, thus potentially promoting the preferentially oxidative degradation of phenol moieties of HS or the oxidative transformation of electron-donating phenol moieties to electron-accepting quinone moieties in the HS structure. Consequently, the EAC and EDC of HSs in soil increase and decrease, respectively. The results of this study could help to understand biogeochemical processes, wherein the redox functionality of soil organic matter is involved in the context of increasing temperature.},

@article{Walpen.2018,
 abstract = {Electron-donating phenolic and electron-accepting quinone moieties in peat dissolved organic matter (DOM) are considered to play key roles in processes defining carbon cycling in northern peatlands. This work advances a flow-injection analysis system coupled to chronoamperometric detection to allow for the simultaneous and highly sensitive determination of these moieties in dilute DOM samples. Analysis of anoxic pore water and oxic pool water samples collected across an ombrotrophic bog in Sweden demonstrated the presence of both phenolic and quinone moieties in peat DOM. The pore water DOM had higher quantities of phenolic but not quinone moieties compared with commonly used model aquatic and terrestrial DOM isolates. Significantly lower phenol content in DOM from oxic pools than DOM from anoxic pore waters indicated oxidative DOM processing in the pools. Consistently, treatment of peat DOM with laccase, a phenol-oxidase, under oxic conditions resulted in an irreversible removal of phenols and reversible oxidation of hydroquinones to quinones. Electron transfer to peat DOM was fully reversible over an electrochemical reduction and subsequent O2-reoxidation cycle, supporting that quinones in peat DOM serve as regenerable microbial electron acceptors in peatlands. The results advance our understanding of redox processes involving phenolic and quinone DOM moieties and their roles in northern peatland carbon cycling.},
