 abstract = {Iron (oxyhydr-)oxide reduction has been extensively studied because of its importance in pollutant redox dynamics and biogeochemical processes. Yet, experimental studies linking oxide reduction kinetics to thermodynamics remain scarce. Here, we used mediated electrochemical reduction (MER) to directly quantify the extents and rates of ferrihydrite, goethite, and hematite reduction over a range of negative reaction free energies, \textgreek{D}rG, that were obtained by systematically varying pH (5.0 to 8.0), applied reduction potentials (-0.53 to -0.17 V vs SHE), and Fe2+ concentrations (up to 40 \textgreek{m}M). Ferrihydrite reduction was complete and fast at all tested \textgreek{D}rG values, consistent with its comparatively low thermodynamic stability. Reduction of the thermodynamically more stable goethite and hematite changed from complete and fast to incomplete and slow as \textgreek{D}rG values became less negative. Reductions at intermediate \textgreek{D}rG values showed negative linear correlations between the natural logarithm of the reduction rate constants and \textgreek{D}rG. These correlations imply that thermodynamics controlled goethite and hematite reduction rates. Beyond allowing to study iron oxide reduction under defined thermodynamic conditions, MER can also be used to capture changes in iron oxide reducibility during phase transformations, as shown for Fe2+-facilitated transformation of ferrihydrite to goethite.},

@article{Aeschbacher.2010,
 abstract = {Two electrochemical methods to assess the redox properties of humic substances (HS) are presented: direct electrochemical reduction (DER) on glassy carbon working electrodes (WE) and mediated electrochemical reduction (MER) and oxidation (MEO) using organic radicals to facilitate electron transfer between HS and the WE. DER allows for continuous monitoring of electron and proton transfer to HS by chronocoulometry and automated acid titration, respectively, and of changes in bulk HS redox potential E(h). Leonardite Humic Acid (LHA) showed an H(+)/e(-) ratio of unity and a decrease in potential from E(h) = +0.18 to -0.23 V upon transfer of 822 mumol(e-) g(LHA)(-1) at pH 7, consistent with quinones as major redox-active functional moieties in LHA. MER and MEO quantitatively detected electrons in LHA samples that were prereduced by DER to different extents. MER and MEO therefore accurately quantify the redox state of HS. Cyclic DER and O(2)-reoxidation revealed that electron transfer to LHA was largely reversible. However, LHA contained a small pool of moieties that were not reoxidized, likely due to endergonic first electron transfer to O(2). Electron accepting capacities of 13 different HS, determined by MER, strongly correlated with their C/H ratios and aromaticities and with previously published values, which, however, were a factor of 3 smaller due to methodological limitations.},

 abstract = {Humic substances play a key role in biogeochemical and pollutant redox reactions. The objective of this work was to characterize the proton and electron transfer equilibria of the reducible moieties in different humic acids (HA). Cyclic voltammetry experiments demonstrated that diquat and ethylviologen mediated electron transfer between carbon working electrodes and HA. These compounds were used also to facilitate attainment of redox equilibria between redox electrodes and HA in potentiometric E(h) measurements. Bulk electrolysis of HA combined with pH-stat acid titration demonstrated that electron transfer to the reducible moieties in HA also resulted in proton uptake, suggesting decreasing reduction potentials E(h) of HA with increasing pH. This was confirmed by potentiometric E(h)-pH titrations of HA at different redox states. E(h) measurements of HA samples prereduced to different redox states by bulk electrolysis revealed reducible moieties in HA that cover a wide range of apparent standard reduction potentials at pH 7 from E(h)(0)* = +0.15 to -0.3 V. Modeling revealed an overall increase in the relative abundance of reducible moieties with decreasing E(h). The wide range of HA is consistent with its involvement in numerous environmental electron transfer reactions under various redox conditions.},

@article{Aeschbacher.2012,
 abstract = {Humic substances (HS) are heterogeneous, redox-active organic macromolecules. While electron transfer to and from HS under reducing conditions is well investigated, comparatively little is known on the electron donating (i.e., antioxidant) properties of HS under oxic conditions. In this work, the electron donating capacities (EDCs) of terrestrial and aquatic HS were quantified by mediated electrochemical oxidation over a wide range of pH values and applied redox potentials (E(h)) using 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) as an electron transfer mediator. Electrochemical oxidation of three model humic acids (HAs) was largely irreversible, and the EDCs of these HAs increased with increasing E(h) and pH. These results suggest that HS contain a wide variety of moieties that are oxidized at different potentials and that, upon oxidation, release protons and undergo irreversible follow-up reactions. At a given pH and E(h), the EDCs of the HS correlated well with their titrated phenol contents suggesting phenolic moieties as major electron donating groups in HS. Comparing the EDCs of 15 HS with their electron accepting capacities (EACs), aquatic HS had higher EDCs and lower EACs than terrestrial HS of comparable aromaticities. These results indicate that oxidative transformation of HS in the environment results in a depletion of electron donating phenolic moieties with antioxidant properties relative to the electron accepting quinone moieties.},

 abstract = {In this work is investigated the possibility of close-binary star systems having Earth-size planets within their habitable zones. First, we selected all known close-binary systems with confirmed planets (totaling 22 systems) to calculate the boundaries of their respective habitable zones (HZ). However, only eight systems had all the data necessary for the computation of the HZ. Then, we numerically explored the stability within the habitable zones for each one of the eight systems using test particles. From the results, we selected five systems that have stable regions inside the habitable zones (HZ), namely Kepler-34, 35, 38, 413 and 453. For these five cases of systems with stable regions in the HZ, we perform a series of numerical simulations for planet formation considering disks composed of planetary embryos and planetesimals, with two distinct density profiles, in addition to the stars and host planets of each system. We found that in the case of Kepler-34 and 453 systems no Earth-size planet is formed within the habitable zones. Although planets with Earth-like masses were formed in the Kepler-453, but they were outside the HZ. In contrast, for Kepler-35 and 38 systems, the results showed that potentially habitable planets are formed in all simulations. In the case of the Kepler-413 system, in just one simulation a terrestrial planet was formed within the habitable zone.},

 abstract = {Information about electron-transfer reactions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is lacking. We determined electron acceptor and donor capacities (EAC and EDC) of a peat humic acid and an untreated peat DOM by electrochemical reduction and reduction with metallic Zn and H2S (EAC), and by oxidation with complexed ferric iron (EDC) at pH 6.5. DOC concentrations (10-100 mg L(-1)) and pH values (4.5-8) were varied in selected experiments. EAC reached up to 6.2 mequiv x (g C)(-1) and EDC reached up to 1.52 mequiv-(g C)(-1). EDC decreased with pH and conversion of chelated to colloidal iron, and the electron-transfer capacity (ETC) was controlled by the redox potential Eh of the reactant (ETC = 1.016x Eh - 0.138; R(2) = 0.87; p = 0.05). The kinetics could be adequately described by pseudo first-order rate laws, one or two DOM pools, and time constants ranging from 2.1 x 10(-3) d-1 to 1.9 x 10(-2) d(-1) for the fast pool. Reactions were completed after 24-160 h depending on the redox couple applied. The results indicate that DOM may act as a redox buffer over electrochemical potentials ranging from -0.9 to +1.0 V.},

They have achieved remarkable success in computation, and enjoy strong theoretical support. Most of the existing literature has focused on the linear Gaussian case; see Bhadra et al. (2019b) for a systematic survey. The purpose of the current article is to demonstrate that the horseshoe regularization is useful far more broadly, by reviewing both methodological and computational developments in complex models that are more relevant to machine learning applications. Specifically, we focus on methodological challenges in horseshoe regularization in nonlinear and non-Gaussian models; multivariate models; and deep neural networks. We also outline the recent computational developments in horseshoe shrinkage for complex models along with a list of available software implementations that allows one to venture out beyond the comfort zone of the canonical linear regression problems.},

 abstract = {The formation of o-quinones from direct 2-electron oxidation of catechols and/or two successive one electron oxidations could explain the cytotoxic/genotoxic and/or chemopreventive effects of several phenolic botanical extracts. For example, poison ivy contains urushiol, an oily mixture, which is oxidized to various o-quinones likely resulting in skin toxicity through oxidative stress and alkylation mechanisms resulting in immune responses. Green tea contains catechins which are directly oxidized to o-quinones by various oxidative enzymes. Alternatively, phenolic botanicals could be o-hydroxylated by P450 to form catechols in vivo which are oxidized to o-quinones. Examples include, resveratrol which is oxidized to piceatannol and further oxidized to the o-quinone. Finally, botanical o-quinones can be formed by O-dealkylation of O-alkoxy groups or methylenedioxy rings resulting in catechols which are further oxidized to o-quinones. Examples include safrole, eugenol, podophyllotoxin and etoposide, as well as methysticin. Once formed these o-quinones have a variety of biological targets in vivo resulting in various biological effects ranging from chemoprevention -{\textgreater} no effect -{\textgreater} toxicity. This U-shaped biological effect curve has been described for a number of reactive intermediates including o-quinones. The current review summarizes the latest data on the formation and biological targets of botanical o-quinones.},

 abstract = {Peat mosses of the genus Sphagnum constitute the bulk of living and dead biomass in bogs. These plants contain peculiar polyphenols which hamper litter peat decomposition through their inhibitory activity on microbial breakdown. In the light of the increasing availability of biologically active nitrogen in natural ecosystems, litter derived from Sphagnum mosses is an ideal substrate to test the potential effects of increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition on polyphenol content in litter peat. To this aim, we measured total nitrogen and soluble polyphenol concentration in Sphagnum litter peat collected in 11 European bogs under a chronic gradient of atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Our results demonstrate that increasing nitrogen concentration in Sphagnum litter, as a consequence of increased exogenous nitrogen availability, is accompanied by a decreasing concentration of polyphenols. This inverse relationship is consistent with reports that in Sphagnum mosses, polyphenol and protein biosynthesis compete for the same precursor. Our observation of modified Sphagnum litter chemistry under chronic nitrogen eutrophication has implications in the context of the global carbon balance, because a lower content of decay-inhibiting polyphenols would accelerate litter peat decomposition.},

 abstract = {Extreme summer droughts are expected to occur more often in the future in NW Europe due to climate change. These droughts might accelerate the rate of peat oxidation in drained peat areas, with impacts on soil subsidence, GHG emission and water quality. This study aimed at providing more insight in the oxidation of deep peat layers that had not previously been exposed to air, the so-called secondary decomposition. We incubated two types of peat (eutrophic and oligotrophic), sampled from permanently anoxic peat layers from nature reserves and agricultural peat meadows. Peat samples were incubated for thirteen weeks under anoxic conditions, but were exposed to air for one to eight weeks. The production of CO2 and CH4 was quantified as a proxy for decomposition; concentrations of soluble nutrients and phenolic compounds were also measured. The results showed that oxygenation led to a steep increase in the rate of decomposition, indicated by higher carbon loss rates during and after oxygenation compared to non-oxygenated samples. Carbon loss rates increased more for eutrophic peat (agricultural area: 352{\%}, nature reserve: 182{\%}) than for oligotrophic peat (83{\%} and 159{\%} respectively). Most peat samples investigated showed higher post-oxygenation CO2 and/or CH4 production compared to the anoxic pre-oxygenation period. This indicates that oxygenation stimulates decomposition, even after anoxic conditions have returned. Contrary to the enzymic latch theory, no effects of oxygenation on the concentrations of soluble or condensed phenolic compounds were detected. Soluble nutrient concentrations did not change due to oxygenation either. Noteworthy is the occurrence of pyrite mineralization and associated acidification in eutrophic peat. Thus, low summer water levels, for example due to climate change, should be avoided in order to limit exceptionally high decomposition rates and associated problems such as increasing subsidence rates, greenhouse gas emission, sulfate release and acidification.},

One major challenge in its utilization is that the majority of this carbon is trapped in the recalcitrant structural polymers of the plant cell wall. Deconstruction of lignin is a key step in the processing of biomass to useful monomers but remains challenging. Microbial systems can provide molecular information on lignin depolymerization as they have evolved to break lignin down using metalloenzyme-dependent radical pathways. Both fungi and bacteria have been observed to metabolize lignin; however, their differential reactivity with this substrate indicates that they may utilize different chemical strategies for its breakdown. This review will discuss recent advances in studying bacterial lignin degradation as an approach to exploring greater diversity in the environment.},

Although recent syntheses have filled some knowledge gaps, the extent and remoteness of many peatlands pose challenges to developing reliable regional carbon accumulation estimates from observations. In this work, we employed an individual- and patch-based dynamic global vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS) with peatland and permafrost functionality to quantify long-term carbon accumulation rates in northern peatlands and to assess the effects of historical and projected future climate change on peatland carbon balance. We combined published datasets of peat basal age to form an up-to-date peat inception surface for the pan-Arctic region which we then used to constrain the model. We divided our analysis into two parts, with a focus both on the carbon accumulation changes detected within the observed peatland boundary and at pan-Arctic scale under two contrasting warming scenarios (representative concentration pathway-RCP8.5 and RCP2.6). We found that peatlands continue to act as carbon sinks under both warming scenarios, but their sink capacity will be substantially reduced under the high-warming (RCP8.5) scenario after 2050. Areas where peat production was initially hampered by permafrost and low productivity were found to accumulate more carbon because of the initial warming and moisture-rich environment due to permafrost thaw, higher precipitation and elevated CO2 levels. On the other hand, we project that areas which will experience reduced precipitation rates and those without permafrost will lose more carbon in the near future, particularly peatlands located in the European region and between 45 and 55°N latitude. Overall, we found that rapid global warming could reduce the carbon sink capacity of the northern peatlands in the coming decades.},

 abstract = {Phenazines, as a type of electron shuttle, are involved in various biological processes to facilitate microbial energy metabolism and electron transfer. They constitute a large group of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, which can be produced by a diverse range of bacteria or by artificial synthesis. They vary significantly in their properties, depending mainly on the nature and position of substitutent group. Thus, it is of great interest to find out the most favorable substituent type and molecular structure of phenazines for electron transfer routes. Here, the impacts of the substituent group on the reduction potentials of phenazine-type redox mediators in aqueous solution were investigated by quantum chemical calculations, and the calculation results were further validated with experimental data. The results show that the reaction free energy was substantially affected by the location of substituent groups on the phenazine molecule and the protonated water clusters. For the main proton addition process, the phenazines substituted with electron-donating groups and those with electron-withdrawing groups interacted with different protonated water clusters, attributed to the proximity effect of water molecules on proton transfer. Thus, high energy conversion efficiency could be achieved by controlling electron flow route with appropriate substituted phenazines to reduce the biological energy acquisition. This study provides useful information for designing efficient redox mediators to promote electron transfer between microbes and terminal acceptors, which are essential to bioenergy recovery from wastes and environmental bioremediation.},

 abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the performance of Bayesian models commonly used for genomic selection to predict {\textquotedbl}difficult-to-predict{\textquotedbl} dairy traits, such as milk fatty acid (FA) expressed as percentage of total fatty acids, and technological properties, such as fresh cheese yield and protein recovery, using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectral data. Our main hypothesis was that Bayesian models that can estimate shrinkage and perform variable selection may improve our ability to predict FA traits and technological traits above and beyond what can be achieved using the current calibration models (e.g., partial least squares, PLS). To this end, we assessed a series of Bayesian methods and compared their prediction performance with that of PLS. The comparison between models was done using the same sets of data (i.e., same samples, same variability, same spectral treatment) for each trait. Data consisted of 1,264 individual milk samples collected from Brown Swiss cows for which gas chromatographic FA composition, milk coagulation properties, and cheese-yield traits were available. For each sample, 2 spectra in the infrared region from 5,011 to 925 cm(-1) were available and averaged before data analysis. Three Bayesian models: Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes RR), Bayes A, and Bayes B, and 2 reference models: PLS and modified PLS (MPLS) procedures, were used to calibrate equations for each of the traits. The Bayesian models used were implemented in the R package BGLR (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BGLR/index.html), whereas the PLS and MPLS were those implemented in the WinISI II software (Infrasoft International LLC, State College, PA). Prediction accuracy was estimated for each trait and model using 25 replicates of a training-testing validation procedure. Compared with PLS, which is currently the most widely used calibration method, MPLS and the 3 Bayesian methods showed significantly greater prediction accuracy. Accuracy increased in moving from calibration to external validation methods, and in moving from PLS and MPLS to Bayesian methods, particularly Bayes A and Bayes B. The maximum R(2) value of validation was obtained with Bayes B and Bayes A. For the FA, C10:0 ({\%} of each FA on total FA basis) had the highest R(2) (0.75, achieved with Bayes A and Bayes B), and among the technological traits, fresh cheese yield R(2) of 0.82 (achieved with Bayes B). These 2 methods have proven to be useful instruments in shrinking and selecting very informative wavelengths and inferring the structure and functions of the analyzed traits. We conclude that Bayesian models are powerful tools for deriving calibration equations, and, importantly, these equations can be easily developed using existing open-source software. As part of our study, we provide scripts based on the open source R software BGLR, which can be used to train customized prediction equations for other traits or populations.},

 abstract = {Peatlands are a major source of atmospheric CH4. The availability of terminal electron acceptors largely affects the ratio of CO2 to CH4 formation under water-logged anoxic conditions in these systems. Although the importance of peat organic matter as an electron acceptor is increasingly recognized, the actual budgets of electron accepting capacities of dissolved and particulate organic matter remain poorly characterized. To address this research need, we incubated three different peat materials and linked changes in the electron accepting capacities (EAC) of peat organic matter (OM), including dissolved and particulate organic matter, to the observed CO2 and CH4 formation. Under anaerobic conditions, EACOM decreased inverse to non-methanogenic CO2 formation. Only after utilizable EACOM was depleted did strictly methanogenic conditions evolve with equimolar CH4 and CO2 formation rates, as theoretically expected. The reduction of OM and the resultant decrease in EACOM explained between 26 and 56{\%} of the non-methanogenic CO2, which was between 5 and 39{\%} of total CO2 produced. Compared to EACPOM, EACDOM remained constant and may have served as a mediator in electron transfer to the POM. In summary, our study quantitatively demonstrated the important role of peat OM as terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration in organic soils.},

Reaction induced FTIR difference spectroscopy is shown to give an essential information on the general geometry of quinone binding sites, the conformation of the ring and of the substituents as well as essential structural information on the identity of the amino-acid residues lining this site.

@article{Hodgkins.2018,
 abstract = {Peatlands represent large terrestrial carbon banks. Given that most peat accumulates in boreal regions, where low temperatures and water saturation preserve organic matter, the existence of peat in (sub)tropical regions remains enigmatic. Here we examined peat and plant chemistry across a latitudinal transect from the Arctic to the tropics. Near-surface low-latitude peat has lower carbohydrate and greater aromatic content than near-surface high-latitude peat, creating a reduced oxidation state and resulting recalcitrance. This recalcitrance allows peat to persist in the (sub)tropics despite warm temperatures. Because we observed similar declines in carbohydrate content with depth in high-latitude peat, our data explain recent field-scale deep peat warming experiments in which catotelm (deeper) peat remained stable despite temperature increases up to 9 °C. We suggest that high-latitude deep peat reservoirs may be stabilized in the face of climate change by their ultimately lower carbohydrate and higher aromatic composition, similar to tropical peats.},

Here we show that manganese oxide (Mn oxide) in a water treatment works filter bed traps dissolved OC as coatings build up in layers around clean sand grains at 3{\%}w/wC. Using spectroscopic and thermogravimetric methods, we identify two main OC fractions. One is thermally refractory ({\textgreater}550 °C) and the other is thermally more labile ({\textless}550 °C). We postulate that the thermal stability of the trapped OC is due to carboxylate groups within it bonding to Mn oxide surfaces coupled with physical entrapment within the layers. We identify a significant difference in the nature of the surface-bound OC and bulk OC . We speculate that polymerization reactions may be occurring at depth within the layers. We also propose that these processes must be considered in future studies of OC in natural systems.},

Here we report extracellular enzyme activities and microbial composition in peatlands of Korea, the UK, Japan and Indonesia, and find higher pH to promote phenol oxidase activities, greater abundances in Actinobacteria and fungi, and enhanced pore-water DOC concentrations. Our pH manipulation experiments also showed that increase in pH enhanced phenol oxidase activity and DOC production with greater Actinobacterial and fungal abundances. Finally, knockout or addition of phenol oxidase dramatically changed DOC and phenolic production, indicating the central role of phenol oxidase in DOC mobilisation. Our findings provide evidence to support a previously unrecognized biological mechanism through which pH increases activate phenol oxidase, accelerating the release of DOC and phenolics.},

 abstract = {Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is becoming an important tool in the study of natural organic matter (NOM) at the molecular level. Ultrahigh-resolution ESI-MS analyses of NOM often produce very complicated spectra; therefore, visual presentation and structural interpretations of the spectra are difficult. To meet this analytical challenge, we herein propose and demonstrate an approach using the van Krevelen diagram. With this approach, complicated mass spectra can be visualized in a way that allows for (1) possible reaction pathways to be identified and presented, and (2) qualitative analyses on major classes of compounds that comprise ultrahigh-resolution spectra. The qualitative analyses are in a good agreement with results obtained from analyses by other analytical techniques. Additionally, the van Krevelen diagram can be expanded to a 3D plot by using peak intensities or relative intensities as the z-axis. The 3D van Krevelen diagram allows for an evaluation of the relative significance of structurally related compounds. The 3D plot can also be a useful tool for compositional differentiation among samples.},

@article{Klotzbucher.2011,
 abstract = {Lignin is a main component of plant litter. Its degradation is thought to be critical for litter decomposition rates and the build-up of soil organic matter. We studied the relationships between lignin degradation and the production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and of CO2 during litter decomposition. Needle or leaf litter of five species (Norway spruce, Scots pine, mountain ash, European beech, sycamore maple) and of different decomposition stage (freshly fallen and up to 27 months of field exposure) was incubated in the laboratory for two years. Lignin degradation was followed with the CuO method. Strong lignin degradation occurred during the first 200 incubation days, as revealed by decreasing yields of lignin-derived phenols. Thereafter lignin degradation leveled off. This pattern was similar for fresh and decomposed litter, and it stands in contrast to the common view of limited lignin degradation in fresh litter. Dissolved organic carbon and CO2 also peaked in the first period of the incubation but were not interrelated. In the later phase of incubation, CO2 production was positively correlated with DOC amounts, suggesting that bioavailable, soluble compounds became a limiting factor for CO2 production. Lignin degradation occurred only when CO2 production was high, and not limited by bioavailable carbon. Thus carbon availability was the most important control on lignin degradation. In turn, lignin degradation could not explain differences in DOC and CO2 production over the study period. Our results challenge the traditional view regarding the fate and role of lignin during litter decomposition. Lignin degradation is controlled by the availability of easily decomposable carbon sources. Consequently, it occurs particularly in the initial phase of litter decomposition and is hampered at later stages if easily decomposable resources decline.},

 abstract = {Permafrost soils contain enormous amounts of organic carbon, which could act as a positive feedback to global climate change due to enhanced respiration rates with warming. We have used a terrestrial ecosystem model that includes permafrost carbon dynamics, inhibition of respiration in frozen soil layers, vertical mixing of soil carbon from surface to permafrost layers, and CH(4) emissions from flooded areas, and which better matches new circumpolar inventories of soil carbon stocks, to explore the potential for carbon-climate feedbacks at high latitudes. Contrary to model results for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4), when permafrost processes are included, terrestrial ecosystems north of 60°N could shift from being a sink to a source of CO(2) by the end of the 21st century when forced by a Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 climate change scenario. Between 1860 and 2100, the model response to combined CO(2) fertilization and climate change changes from a sink of 68 Pg to a 27 + -7 Pg sink to 4 + -18 Pg source, depending on the processes and parameter values used. The integrated change in carbon due to climate change shifts from near zero, which is within the range of previous model estimates, to a climate-induced loss of carbon by ecosystems in the range of 25 + -3 to 85 + -16 Pg C, depending on processes included in the model, with a best estimate of a 62 + -7 Pg C loss. Methane emissions from high-latitude regions are calculated to increase from 34 Tg CH(4)/y to 41-70 Tg CH(4)/y, with increases due to CO(2) fertilization, permafrost thaw, and warming-induced increased CH(4) flux densities partially offset by a reduction in wetland extent.},

To investigate hydrogen bond formation in lignin, an abundant natural polymer found in plants, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis of various lignin model compounds was performed. Four monomeric model compounds and one dimeric model compound were studied under various conditions. FTIR analysis revealed aliphatic hydroxyl groups form stronger hydrogen bonds than phenolic hydroxyl groups. Further, the dimeric biphenyl-type structure formed significantly stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonds as compared to the other monomeric model compounds. Results from the model compound studies were used to explain the observed complex hydrogen-bonding system present in both softwood and hardwood technical lignins. Together with chemical analysis, we discuss the difference in hydrogen bonding between hardwood and softwood lignin and the observed differences in the glass transition temperature.},

Organic C and soil N were measured for 1310 samples from 48 sites in Switzerland, and H and O for 1165. The soil OM content and C/N ratio were most sensitive to land use and are hence best suited as indicators for peatland degradation. OM contents (CL {\textless} GL {\textless} FL {\textless} NL), H/C, O/C, C/N ratios, and OM oxidation states were significantly different between land use types in top- and subsoils. With decreasing bulk OM content, C was relatively depleted while H and particularly N were higher. The data suggest very high N mobilization rates from strongly decomposed peat in agricultural topsoil. A comparison to peat C and N from mostly intact peatlands of the Northern hemisphere reveals that agriculture and, to a lesser extent, forestry induce a progressed state of soil degradation.},

 abstract = {As one of the most abundant polymers in biosphere, lignin has attracted extensive attention as a kind of promising feedstock for biofuel and bio-based products. However, the utilization of lignin presents various challenges in that its complex composition and structure and high resistance to degradation. Lignin conversion through biological platform harnesses the catalytic power of microorganisms to decompose complex lignin molecules and obtain value-added products through biosynthesis. Given the heterogeneity of lignin, various microbial metabolic pathways are involved in lignin bioconversion processes, which has been characterized in extensive research work. With different types of lignin substrates (e.g., model compounds, technical lignin, and lignocellulosic biomass), several bacterial and fungal species have been proved to own lignin-degrading abilities and accumulate microbial products (e.g., lipid and polyhydroxyalkanoates), while the lignin conversion efficiencies are still relatively low. Genetic and metabolic strategies have been developed to enhance lignin biodegradation by reprogramming microbial metabolism, and diverse products, such as vanillin and dicarboxylic acids were also produced from lignin. This article aims at presenting a comprehensive review on lignin bioconversion including lignin degradation mechanisms, metabolic pathways, and applications for the production of value-added bioproducts. Advanced techniques on genetic and metabolic engineering are also covered in the recent development of biological platforms for lignin utilization. To conclude this article, the existing challenges for efficient lignin bioprocessing are analyzed and possible directions for future work are proposed.},

@article{Mathijssen.2019,
 abstract = {Peat carbon accumulation is controlled by both large scale factors, such as climate and hydrological setting, and small scale factors, such as microtopography and plant community. These small scale factors commonly vary within peatlands and can cause variation in biogeochemical traits and carbon accumulation within the same site. To understand these within-site variations, we investigated long term carbon accumulation, peat decomposition, biogeochemistry of pore water and plant macrofossils along a transect in an ombrotrophic bog in southern Patagonia. An additional question we addressed is how historical deposition of volcanic ash on the peatland has affected its carbon balance. Variability in plant community and water table led to differences in long term peat and carbon accumulation (peat moss {\textgreater} cushion plant), organic matter decomposition (cushion plant {\textgreater} peat moss), and methane production (peat moss {\textgreater} cushion plant). Macrofossil analysis and radiocarbon dating indicated a relationship between plant community and carbon accumulation or decomposition during the historical succession of vegetation in the peatland. C/N ratio and isotopic signatures reflected variability in plant community as litter source, and DOC concentrations were controlled by humification level. Volcanic ash deposition had only limited effect on plant composition, but it was associated with increased decomposition in overlying peat layers. This study highlights the importance of understanding how plant communities develop, as changes in communities could significantly affect the potential of ombrotrophic peatlands as C sink.},

@article{Pavitt.2019,
 abstract = {The complex and indeterminant composition of NOM makes characterization of its redox properties challenging. Approaches that have been taken to address this challenge include chemical probe reactions, potentiometric titrations, chronocoulometry, and voltammetry. In this study, we revisit the use of direct voltammetric methods in aprotic solvents by applying an expanded and refined suite of methods to a large set of NOM samples and model compounds (54 NOM samples from 10 different sources, 7 NOM model compounds, and 2 fresh extracts of plant materials that are high in redox-active quinonoid model compounds dissolved in DMSO). Refinements in the methods of fitting the data obtained by staircase cyclic voltammetry (SCV) provided improved definition of peaks, and square wave voltammetry (SWV), performed under the same conditions as SCV, provided even more reliable identification and quantitation of peaks. Further evidence is provided that DMSO improves the electrode response by unfolding some of the tertiary structure of NOM polymers, thereby allowing greater contact between redox active functional groups and the electrode surface. We averaged experimental peak potentials for all NOM compounds and calculated potentials in water. Average values for Epa1, Epc1, and Ep1 in DMSO were -0.866 $\pm$ 0.069, -1.35 $\pm$ 0.071, and -0.831 $\pm$ 0.051 V vs. Ag/Ag+, and -0.128, -0.613, and -0.0930 V vs. SHE in water. In addition to peak potentials, the breadth of SCV peaks was quantified as a way to characterize the degree to which the redox activity of NOM is due to a continuum of contributing functional groups. The average breadth values were 1.63 $\pm$ 0.24, 1.28 $\pm$ 0.34, and 0.648 $\pm$ 0.15 V for Epa1, Epc1, and Ep1 respectively. Comparative analysis of the overall dataset-from SCV and SWV on all NOMs and model compounds-revealed that NOM redox properties vary over a narrower range than expected based on model compound properties. This lack of diversity in redox properties of NOM is similar to conclusions from other recent work on the molecular structure of NOM, all of which could be the result of selectivity in the common extraction methods used to obtain the materials.},

 abstract = {Cyclic oxidation and reduction reactions using oxygen and palladium with H2, respectively, of dissolved humic and fulvic acids (HA and FA) and model quinone compounds were used to structurally characterize and quantify the electron-carrying capacity (ECC) of reversible redox sites present in humic substances. This technique was used to examine 8 quinone compounds and 14 HA and FA samples and identified 3 redox sites as a function of their stability against the Pd-catalyzed hydrogenolysis process. Six highly aliphatic HA and FA isolated from landfill leachate did not contain redox sites under any conditions; however, the other HA and FA demonstrated reversible redox properties characterized by a combination of three redox sites. On the basis of the model compound results, it is proposed that one site consists of a non-quinone structure (NQ) and the other two sites have quinone structures. The two quinone sites differ in that one group (Q1) has electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to the quinone functional group while the second group (Q2) contains either no substituents near the quinone or has nearby electron-donating groups with additional substitutents hindering hydrogenolysis through steric interactions. The reversible ECC of NQ sites ranged from 25 to 265 microequiv e- transferred/g HA or FA, representing 21-56{\%} of the total ECC of the HA and FA when measured with the mildest reducing method (pH 8.0, pure Pd). Q1 redox sites resistant to hydrogenolysis at pH 8.0 using Pd/Al2O3 accounted for 13-58{\%} of the total ECC and ranged from 40 to 120 microequiv e-/ g HA or FA. The most sensitive O2 reversible redox sites accounted for 8-50{\%} of the total ECC (20-220 microequiv e-/ g HA or FA). These results directly demonstrate that HA and FA are capable of acting as reversible electron-transfer agents using different functional groups, some of which may not be quinones.},

The cycle voltammetrys of nitrobenzene derivatives on the MWNTs modified electrodes can be easily tuned by changing the substituted groups of nitrobenzene. Based on the experimental data, the electrochemical reaction mechanisms of nitrobenzene and its derivatives on the MWNTs modified electrodes have been discussed and analyzed.},

Dichroic infrared spectra of fibers placed in a custom-built microfluidic cuvette were acquired in air, in liquid (heavy) water, and in liquid dimethylacetamide using a novel combination of synchrotron-based Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy with polarization modulation. Differences were observed in the O-H stretching frequency region of the spruce spectra upon changing the ambient conditions. Analysis of these spectral variations provides information on hydrogen bonding, orientation, and accessibility of structural units of the wood polymers in the spruce cell walls. Our in situ approach contributes to a further understanding of the structural details of wood polymers in their native setting.},

 abstract = {The electron transfer capacities (ETCs) of soil humic substances (HSs) are linked to the type and abundance of redox-active functional moieties in their structure. Natural temperature can affect the chemical structure of natural organic matter by regulating their oxidative transformation and degradation in soil. However, it is unclear if there is a direct correlation between ETC of soil HS and mean annual temperature. In this study, we assess the response of the electron-accepting and -donating capacities (EAC and EDC) of soil HSs to temperature by analyzing HSs extracted from soil set along glacial-interglacial cycles through loess-palaeosol sequences and along natural temperature gradients through latitude and altitude transects. We show that the EAC and EDC of soil HSs increase and decrease, respectively, with increasing temperature. Increased temperature facilitates the prevalence of oxidative degradation and transformation of HS in soils, thus potentially promoting the preferentially oxidative degradation of phenol moieties of HS or the oxidative transformation of electron-donating phenol moieties to electron-accepting quinone moieties in the HS structure. Consequently, the EAC and EDC of HSs in soil increase and decrease, respectively. The results of this study could help to understand biogeochemical processes, wherein the redox functionality of soil organic matter is involved in the context of increasing temperature.},

 abstract = {The formation and turnover of soil organic matter (SOM) includes the biogeochemical processing of the macronutrient elements nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulphur (S), which alters their stoichiometric relationships to carbon (C) and to each other. We sought patterns among soil organic C, N, P and S in data for c. 2000 globally distributed soil samples, covering all soil horizons. For non-peat soils, strong negative correlations (p~{\textless}~0.001) were found between N:C, P:C and S:C ratios and {\%} organic carbon (OC), showing that SOM of soils with low OC concentrations (high in mineral matter) is rich in N, P and S. The results can be described approximately with a simple mixing model in which nutrient-poor SOM (NPSOM) has N:C, P:C and S:C ratios of 0.039, 0.0011 and 0.0054, while nutrient-rich SOM (NRSOM) has corresponding ratios of 0.12, 0.016 and 0.016, so that P is especially enriched in NRSOM compared to NPSOM. The trends hold across a range of ecosystems, for topsoils, including O horizons, and subsoils, and across different soil classes. The major exception is that tropical soils tend to have low P:C ratios especially at low N:C. We suggest that NRSOM comprises compounds selected by their strong adsorption to mineral matter. The stoichiometric patterns established here offer a new quantitative framework for SOM classification and characterisation, and provide important constraints to dynamic soil and ecosystem models of carbon turnover and nutrient dynamics.},

 abstract = {The role of quinone biomolecules and quinone moieties of natural organic matter (NOM) as the electron transfer mediator in essential biogeochemical processes such as iron bioreduction and contaminant degradation has received considerable interests in the past decade. Hypothesized electron shuttling mechanism must be evaluated based on the availability and stability of quinones under a given environmental setting. The goal of this review is to examine the source, reactivity, and fate of potential quinone catalysts with respect to chemical interactions (e.g., with other quinones and nucleophiles) that will inevitably occur in complex environmental media. We will first discuss natural and anthropogenic sources of quinones in aqueous environments, and fundamental transformation pathways including cross reaction, autoxidation, and addition reactions. We will then assess how the described sources (molecular structure) and transformation pathways (stability) will impact the ability of a quinone molecule to catalyze a biogeochemical process. Thermodynamics and kinetics of electron transfer reactions with both the electron donor (e.g., hydrogen sulfide as a bulk reductant) and the terminal electron acceptor (e.g., nitroaromatic explosives in contaminant degradation), and stability towards irreversible side reactions are the key factors determining the geochemical conditions under which the catalysis by a quinone molecule will be operative.},

 abstract = {Electron donating capacity (EDC) values were determined for a set of pore water samples collected from the sediments of four separate wetlands in the Cottonwood Lakes Study Area in Jamestown, ND by mediated electrochemical analysis, reaction with substituted nitro(so)benzenes, and calculation based on measured organic carbon and sulfide concentrations. The samples were taken from four hydrologically connected and increasingly sulfidic wetlands within the study site. Parallel trends in EDC values related to hydrologic conditions and to in situ reduced sulfur content were observed by all three methodologies. In particular, it was found that sulfide and dissolved organic matter (DOM) are the primary and secondary reductants, respectively, in these systems. The efficacy of these reductants in transforming organic contaminants, however, is largely driven by native pore water reduced sulfur content. Manipulation of the systems demonstrate that while DOM is capable of reducing highly oxidized contaminants or reactive intermediates, this likely only occurs once the reducing capacity of the sulfide is exhausted. Sulfide therefore was the dominant electron donor in the pore water samples.},

This work presents an automated and highly sensitive flow injection analysis (FIA) system coupled to both spectrophotometric and electrochemical detection to quantify electron-donating phenolic moieties in DOM by determining the number of electrons that these moieties transfer to an added chemical oxidant, the radical cation of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS(•+)). The FIA system was successfully validated using Trolox as a redox standard. Highest method sensitivity was attained when combining the FIA with chronoamperometric detection, resulting in limits of quantification of picomolar amounts of Trolox and nanogram amounts of DOM (corresponding to solutions with {\textless}1 mg carbon per liter). The analysis of DOM isolates showed a strong linear correlation between the number of electrons donated and their titrated phenol contents, supporting oxidation of phenols by ABTS(•+). The broad application spectrum of the FIA system to dilute natural DOM samples was illustrated by analyzing water samples collected from northern peatlands and by monitoring the oxidation of phenols in one peat sample upon incubation with a phenol oxidase. The superior analytical capability of the FIA system allows quantifying phenols and monitoring phenol dynamics in dilute DOM samples.},

This work advances a flow-injection analysis system coupled to chronoamperometric detection to allow for the simultaneous and highly sensitive determination of these moieties in dilute DOM samples. Analysis of anoxic pore water and oxic pool water samples collected across an ombrotrophic bog in Sweden demonstrated the presence of both phenolic and quinone moieties in peat DOM. The pore water DOM had higher quantities of phenolic but not quinone moieties compared with commonly used model aquatic and terrestrial DOM isolates. Significantly lower phenol content in DOM from oxic pools than DOM from anoxic pore waters indicated oxidative DOM processing in the pools. Consistently, treatment of peat DOM with laccase, a phenol-oxidase, under oxic conditions resulted in an irreversible removal of phenols and reversible oxidation of hydroquinones to quinones. Electron transfer to peat DOM was fully reversible over an electrochemical reduction and subsequent O2-reoxidation cycle, supporting that quinones in peat DOM serve as regenerable microbial electron acceptors in peatlands. The results advance our understanding of redox processes involving phenolic and quinone DOM moieties and their roles in northern peatland carbon cycling.},

 abstract = {Peat particulate organic matter (POM) is an important terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration in northern peatlands provided that the electron-accepting capacity of POM is periodically restored by oxidation with O2 during peat oxygenation events. We employed push-pull tests with dissolved O2 as reactant to determine pseudo-first-order rate constants of O2 consumption ( kobs) in anoxic peat soil of an unperturbed Swedish ombrotrophic bog. Dissolved O2 was rapidly consumed in anoxic peat with a mean kobs of 2.91 $\pm$ 0.60 h-1, corresponding to an O2 half-life of $\sim$14 min. POM dominated O2 consumption, as evidenced from approximately 50-fold smaller kobs in POM-free control tests. Inhibiting microbial activity with formaldehyde did not appreciably slow O2 consumption, supporting abiotic O2 reduction by POM moieties, not aerobic respiration, as the primary route of O2 consumption. Peat preoxygenation with dissolved O2 lowered kobs in subsequent oxygen consumption tests, consistent with depletion of reduced moieties in POM. Finally, repeated oxygen consumption tests demonstrated that anoxic peat POM has a high reduction capacity, in excess to 20 \textgreek{m}mol electrons donated per gram POM. This work demonstrates rapid abiotic oxidation of reduced POM by O2, supporting that short-term oxygenation events can restore the capacity of POM to accept electrons from anaerobic respiration in temporarily anoxic parts of peatlands.},

While experiments have shown that LPMOs are copper dependent enzymes requiring an electron donor, the mechanism and origin of the electron supply in biological systems are only partly understood. We show here that insoluble high molecular weight lignin functions as a reservoir of electrons facilitating LPMO activity. The electrons are donated to the enzyme by long-range electron transfer involving soluble low molecular weight lignins present in plant cell walls. Electron transfer was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy showing that LPMO activity on cellulose changes the level of unpaired electrons in the lignin. The discovery of a long-range electron transfer mechanism links the biodegradation of cellulose and lignin and sheds new light on how oxidative enzymes present in plant degraders may act in concert.},

This new edition to the classic book by ggplot2 creator Hadley Wickham highlights compatibility with knitr and RStudio. ggplot2 is a data visualization package for R that helps users create data graphics, including those that are multi-layered, with ease. With ggplot2, it's easy to: • produce handsome, publication-quality plots with automatic legends created from the plot specification • superimpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots) from different data sources with automatically adjusted common scales • add customizable smoothers that use powerful modeling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalized additive models, and robust regression • save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse • create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements and that can easily be applied to multiple plots • approach a graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying data in an informative and attractive way. Some basic knowledge of R is necessary (e.g., importing data into R). ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page. New to this edition:{\textless} • Brings the book up-to-date with ggplot2 1.0, including major updates to the theme system • New scales, stats and geoms added throughout • Additional practice exercises • A revised introduction that focuses on ggplot() instead of qplot() • Updated chapters on data and modeling using tidyr, dplyr and broom},

@article{Zheng.2013,
 abstract = {Mercuric ion, Hg(2+), forms strong complexes with thiolate compounds that commonly dominate Hg(II) speciation in natural freshwater. However, reactions between dissolved aqueous elemental mercury (Hg(0)aq) and organic ligands in general, and thiol compounds in particular, are not well studied although these reactions likely affect Hg speciation and cycling in the environment. In this study, we compared the reaction rates between Hg(0)aq and a number of selected organic ligands with varying molecular structures and sulfur (S) oxidation states in dark, anoxic conditions to assess the role of these ligands in Hg(0)aq oxidation. Significant Hg(0)aq oxidation was observed with all thiols but not with ligands containing no S. Compounds with oxidized S (e.g., disulfide) exhibited little or no reactivity toward Hg(0)aq either at pH 7. The rate and extent of Hg(0)aq oxidation varied greatly depending on the chemical and structural properties of thiols, thiol/Hg ratios, and the presence or absence of electron acceptors. Smaller aliphatic thiols and higher thiol/Hg ratios resulted in higher Hg(0)aq oxidation rates than larger aromatic thiols at lower thiol/Hg ratios. The addition of electron acceptors (e.g., humic acid) also led to substantially increased Hg(0)aq oxidation. Our results suggest that thiol-induced oxidation of Hg(0)aq is important under anoxic conditions and can affect Hg redox transformation and bioavailability for microbial methylation.},
