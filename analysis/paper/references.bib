  Title = {{Novel electrochemical approach to assess the redox properties of humic substances}},
  Volume = {44},
  Year = {2010},
  Abstract = {Two electrochemical methods to assess the redox properties of humic substances (HS) are presented: direct electrochemical reduction (DER) on glassy carbon working electrodes (WE) and mediated electrochemical reduction (MER) and oxidation (MEO) using organic radicals to facilitate electron transfer between HS and the WE. DER allows for continuous monitoring of electron and proton transfer to HS by chronocoulometry and automated acid titration, respectively, and of changes in bulk HS redox potential E(h). Leonardite Humic Acid (LHA) showed an H(+)/e(-) ratio of unity and a decrease in potential from E(h) = +0.18 to -0.23 V upon transfer of 822 mumol(e-) g(LHA)(-1) at pH 7, consistent with quinones as major redox-active functional moieties in LHA. MER and MEO quantitatively detected electrons in LHA samples that were prereduced by DER to different extents. MER and MEO therefore accurately quantify the redox state of HS. Cyclic DER and O(2)-reoxidation revealed that electron transfer to LHA was largely reversible. However, LHA contained a small pool of moieties that were not reoxidized, likely due to endergonic first electron transfer to O(2). Electron accepting capacities of 13 different HS, determined by MER, strongly correlated with their C/H ratios and aromaticities and with previously published values, which, however, were a factor of 3 smaller due to methodological limitations.},

  Volume = {45},
  Year = {2011},
  Abstract = {Humic substances play a key role in biogeochemical and pollutant redox reactions. The objective of this work was to characterize the proton and electron transfer equilibria of the reducible moieties in different humic acids (HA). Cyclic voltammetry experiments demonstrated that diquat and ethylviologen mediated electron transfer between carbon working electrodes and HA. These compounds were used also to facilitate attainment of redox equilibria between redox electrodes and HA in potentiometric E(h) measurements. Bulk electrolysis of HA combined with pH-stat acid titration demonstrated that electron transfer to the reducible moieties in HA also resulted in proton uptake, suggesting decreasing reduction potentials E(h) of HA with increasing pH. This was confirmed by potentiometric E(h)-pH titrations of HA at different redox states. E(h) measurements of HA samples prereduced to different redox states by bulk electrolysis revealed reducible moieties in HA that cover a wide range of apparent standard reduction potentials at pH 7 from E(h)(0)* = +0.15 to -0.3 V. Modeling revealed an overall increase in the relative abundance of reducible moieties with decreasing E(h). The wide range of HA is consistent with its involvement in numerous environmental electron transfer reactions under various redox conditions.},

  Title = {{Antioxidant properties of humic substances}},
  Volume = {46},
  Year = {2012},
  Abstract = {Humic substances (HS) are heterogeneous, redox-active organic macromolecules. While electron transfer to and from HS under reducing conditions is well investigated, comparatively little is known on the electron donating (i.e., antioxidant) properties of HS under oxic conditions. In this work, the electron donating capacities (EDCs) of terrestrial and aquatic HS were quantified by mediated electrochemical oxidation over a wide range of pH values and applied redox potentials (E(h)) using 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) as an electron transfer mediator. Electrochemical oxidation of three model humic acids (HAs) was largely irreversible, and the EDCs of these HAs increased with increasing E(h) and pH. These results suggest that HS contain a wide variety of moieties that are oxidized at different potentials and that, upon oxidation, release protons and undergo irreversible follow-up reactions. At a given pH and E(h), the EDCs of the HS correlated well with their titrated phenol contents suggesting phenolic moieties as major electron donating groups in HS. Comparing the EDCs of 15 HS with their electron accepting capacities (EACs), aquatic HS had higher EDCs and lower EACs than terrestrial HS of comparable aromaticities. These results indicate that oxidative transformation of HS in the environment results in a depletion of electron donating phenolic moieties with antioxidant properties relative to the electron accepting quinone moieties.},

  Title = {{Electron Hopping Enables Rapid Electron Transfer between Quinone-/Hydroquinone-Containing Organic Molecules in Microbial Iron(III) Mineral Reduction}},
  Volume = {54},
  Year = {2020},
  Abstract = {The mechanism of long-distance electron transfer via redox-active particulate natural organic matter (NOM) is still unclear, especially considering its aggregated nature and the resulting low diffusivity of its quinone- and hydroquinone-containing molecules. Here we conducted microbial iron(III) mineral reduction experiments in which anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS, a widely used analogue for quinone- and hydroquinone-containing molecules in NOM) was immobilized in agar to achieve a spatial separation between the iron-reducing bacteria and ferrihydrite mineral. Immobilizing AQDS in agar also limited its diffusion, which resembled electron-transfer behavior of quinone- and hydroquinone-containing molecules in particulate NOM. We found that, although the diffusion coefficient of the immobilized AQDS/AH2QDS was 10 times lower in agar than in water, the iron(III) mineral reduction rate (1.60 $\pm$ 0.28 mmol L-1 Fe(II) d-1) was still comparable in both media, indicating the existence of another mechanism that accelerated the electron transfer under low diffusive conditions. We found the correlation between the heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constant (10-3 cm s-1) and the diffusion coefficient (10-7 cm2 s-1) fitting well with the {\textquotedbl}diffusion-electron hopping{\textquotedbl} model, suggesting that electron transfer via the immobilized AQDS/AH2QDS couple was accomplished through a combination of diffusion and electron hopping. Electron hopping increased the diffusion concentration gradient up to 106-fold, which largely promoted the overall electron-transfer rate during microbial iron(III) mineral reduction. Our results are helpful to explain the electron-transfer mechanisms in particulate NOM.},

  Volume = {120},
  Year = {2018},
  Abstract = {The formation of o-quinones from direct 2-electron oxidation of catechols and/or two successive one electron oxidations could explain the cytotoxic/genotoxic and/or chemopreventive effects of several phenolic botanical extracts. For example, poison ivy contains urushiol, an oily mixture, which is oxidized to various o-quinones likely resulting in skin toxicity through oxidative stress and alkylation mechanisms resulting in immune responses. Green tea contains catechins which are directly oxidized to o-quinones by various oxidative enzymes. Alternatively, phenolic botanicals could be o-hydroxylated by P450 to form catechols in vivo which are oxidized to o-quinones. Examples include, resveratrol which is oxidized to piceatannol and further oxidized to the o-quinone. Finally, botanical o-quinones can be formed by O-dealkylation of O-alkoxy groups or methylenedioxy rings resulting in catechols which are further oxidized to o-quinones. Examples include safrole, eugenol, podophyllotoxin and etoposide, as well as methysticin. Once formed these o-quinones have a variety of biological targets in vivo resulting in various biological effects ranging from chemoprevention -{\textgreater} no effect -{\textgreater} toxicity. This U-shaped biological effect curve has been described for a number of reactive intermediates including o-quinones. The current review summarizes the latest data on the formation and biological targets of botanical o-quinones.},

  Volume = {377},
  Year = {2007},
  Abstract = {Peat mosses of the genus Sphagnum constitute the bulk of living and dead biomass in bogs. These plants contain peculiar polyphenols which hamper litter peat decomposition through their inhibitory activity on microbial breakdown. In the light of the increasing availability of biologically active nitrogen in natural ecosystems, litter derived from Sphagnum mosses is an ideal substrate to test the potential effects of increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition on polyphenol content in litter peat. To this aim, we measured total nitrogen and soluble polyphenol concentration in Sphagnum litter peat collected in 11 European bogs under a chronic gradient of atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Our results demonstrate that increasing nitrogen concentration in Sphagnum litter, as a consequence of increased exogenous nitrogen availability, is accompanied by a decreasing concentration of polyphenols. This inverse relationship is consistent with reports that in Sphagnum mosses, polyphenol and protein biosynthesis compete for the same precursor. Our observation of modified Sphagnum litter chemistry under chronic nitrogen eutrophication has implications in the context of the global carbon balance, because a lower content of decay-inhibiting polyphenols would accelerate litter peat decomposition.},

  Title = {{Bayesian regression models outperform partial least squares methods for predicting milk components and technological properties using infrared spectral data}},
  Volume = {98},
  Year = {2015},
  Abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the performance of Bayesian models commonly used for genomic selection to predict {\textquotedbl}difficult-to-predict{\textquotedbl} dairy traits, such as milk fatty acid (FA) expressed as percentage of total fatty acids, and technological properties, such as fresh cheese yield and protein recovery, using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectral data. Our main hypothesis was that Bayesian models that can estimate shrinkage and perform variable selection may improve our ability to predict FA traits and technological traits above and beyond what can be achieved using the current calibration models (e.g., partial least squares, PLS). To this end, we assessed a series of Bayesian methods and compared their prediction performance with that of PLS. The comparison between models was done using the same sets of data (i.e., same samples, same variability, same spectral treatment) for each trait. Data consisted of 1,264 individual milk samples collected from Brown Swiss cows for which gas chromatographic FA composition, milk coagulation properties, and cheese-yield traits were available. For each sample, 2 spectra in the infrared region from 5,011 to 925 cm(-1) were available and averaged before data analysis. Three Bayesian models: Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes RR), Bayes A, and Bayes B, and 2 reference models: PLS and modified PLS (MPLS) procedures, were used to calibrate equations for each of the traits. The Bayesian models used were implemented in the R package BGLR (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BGLR/index.html), whereas the PLS and MPLS were those implemented in the WinISI II software (Infrasoft International LLC, State College, PA). Prediction accuracy was estimated for each trait and model using 25 replicates of a training-testing validation procedure. Compared with PLS, which is currently the most widely used calibration method, MPLS and the 3 Bayesian methods showed significantly greater prediction accuracy. Accuracy increased in moving from calibration to external validation methods, and in moving from PLS and MPLS to Bayesian methods, particularly Bayes A and Bayes B. The maximum R(2) value of validation was obtained with Bayes B and Bayes A. For the FA, C10:0 ({\%} of each FA on total FA basis) had the highest R(2) (0.75, achieved with Bayes A and Bayes B), and among the technological traits, fresh cheese yield R(2) of 0.82 (achieved with Bayes B). These 2 methods have proven to be useful instruments in shrinking and selecting very informative wavelengths and inferring the structure and functions of the analyzed traits. We conclude that Bayesian models are powerful tools for deriving calibration equations, and, importantly, these equations can be easily developed using existing open-source software. As part of our study, we provide scripts based on the open source R software BGLR, which can be used to train customized prediction equations for other traits or populations.},

  Title = {{Electron accepting capacity of dissolved and particulate organic matter control CO2 and CH4 formation in peat soils}},
  Volume = {245},
  Year = {2019},
  Abstract = {Peatlands are a major source of atmospheric CH4. The availability of terminal electron acceptors largely affects the ratio of CO2 to CH4 formation under water-logged anoxic conditions in these systems. Although the importance of peat organic matter as an electron acceptor is increasingly recognized, the actual budgets of electron accepting capacities of dissolved and particulate organic matter remain poorly characterized. To address this research need, we incubated three different peat materials and linked changes in the electron accepting capacities (EAC) of peat organic matter (OM), including dissolved and particulate organic matter, to the observed CO2 and CH4 formation. Under anaerobic conditions, EACOM decreased inverse to non-methanogenic CO2 formation. Only after utilizable EACOM was depleted did strictly methanogenic conditions evolve with equimolar CH4 and CO2 formation rates, as theoretically expected. The reduction of OM and the resultant decrease in EACOM explained between 26 and 56{\%} of the non-methanogenic CO2, which was between 5 and 39{\%} of total CO2 produced. Compared to EACPOM, EACDOM remained constant and may have served as a mediator in electron transfer to the POM. In summary, our study quantitatively demonstrated the important role of peat OM as terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration in organic soils.},

  Volume = {9},
  Year = {2018},
  Abstract = {Peatlands represent large terrestrial carbon banks. Given that most peat accumulates in boreal regions, where low temperatures and water saturation preserve organic matter, the existence of peat in (sub)tropical regions remains enigmatic. Here we examined peat and plant chemistry across a latitudinal transect from the Arctic to the tropics. Near-surface low-latitude peat has lower carbohydrate and greater aromatic content than near-surface high-latitude peat, creating a reduced oxidation state and resulting recalcitrance. This recalcitrance allows peat to persist in the (sub)tropics despite warm temperatures. Because we observed similar declines in carbohydrate content with depth in high-latitude peat, our data explain recent field-scale deep peat warming experiments in which catotelm (deeper) peat remained stable despite temperature increases up to 9 °C. We suggest that high-latitude deep peat reservoirs may be stabilized in the face of climate change by their ultimately lower carbohydrate and higher aromatic composition, similar to tropical peats.},

  Volume = {6},
  Year = {2015},
  Abstract = {Minerals stabilize organic carbon (OC) in sediments, thereby directly affecting global climate at multiple scales, but how they do it is far from understood. Here we show that manganese oxide (Mn oxide) in a water treatment works filter bed traps dissolved OC as coatings build up in layers around clean sand grains at 3{\%}w/wC. Using spectroscopic and thermogravimetric methods, we identify two main OC fractions. One is thermally refractory ({\textgreater}550 °C) and the other is thermally more labile ({\textless}550 °C). We postulate that the thermal stability of the trapped OC is due to carboxylate groups within it bonding to Mn oxide surfaces coupled with physical entrapment within the layers. We identify a significant difference in the nature of the surface-bound OC and bulk OC . We speculate that polymerization reactions may be occurring at depth within the layers. We also propose that these processes must be considered in future studies of OC in natural systems.},

  Volume = {9},
  Year = {2018},
  Abstract = {Peatlands store 1/3 of global soil carbon, destabilisation of which contributes much to the recent increase in DOC (dissolved organic carbon) in freshwater ecosystems. One suggested mechanism for the enhanced decomposition of peat and the releases of DOC is recovery from acidification. However, no biological role in the process has yet been identified. Here we report extracellular enzyme activities and microbial composition in peatlands of Korea, the UK, Japan and Indonesia, and find higher pH to promote phenol oxidase activities, greater abundances in Actinobacteria and fungi, and enhanced pore-water DOC concentrations. Our pH manipulation experiments also showed that increase in pH enhanced phenol oxidase activity and DOC production with greater Actinobacterial and fungal abundances. Finally, knockout or addition of phenol oxidase dramatically changed DOC and phenolic production, indicating the central role of phenol oxidase in DOC mobilisation. Our findings provide evidence to support a previously unrecognized biological mechanism through which pH increases activate phenol oxidase, accelerating the release of DOC and phenolics.},

  Abstract = {Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is becoming an important tool in the study of natural organic matter (NOM) at the molecular level. Ultrahigh-resolution ESI-MS analyses of NOM often produce very complicated spectra; therefore, visual presentation and structural interpretations of the spectra are difficult. To meet this analytical challenge, we herein propose and demonstrate an approach using the van Krevelen diagram. With this approach, complicated mass spectra can be visualized in a way that allows for (1) possible reaction pathways to be identified and presented, and (2) qualitative analyses on major classes of compounds that comprise ultrahigh-resolution spectra. The qualitative analyses are in a good agreement with results obtained from analyses by other analytical techniques. Additionally, the van Krevelen diagram can be expanded to a 3D plot by using peak intensities or relative intensities as the z-axis. The 3D van Krevelen diagram allows for an evaluation of the relative significance of structurally related compounds. The 3D plot can also be a useful tool for compositional differentiation among samples.},

  Abstract = {Hydrogen bonding plays an important role in the thermal and mechanical properties of biopolymers. To investigate hydrogen bond formation in lignin, an abundant natural polymer found in plants, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis of various lignin model compounds was performed. Four monomeric model compounds and one dimeric model compound were studied under various conditions. FTIR analysis revealed aliphatic hydroxyl groups form stronger hydrogen bonds than phenolic hydroxyl groups. Further, the dimeric biphenyl-type structure formed significantly stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonds as compared to the other monomeric model compounds. Results from the model compound studies were used to explain the observed complex hydrogen-bonding system present in both softwood and hardwood technical lignins. Together with chemical analysis, we discuss the difference in hydrogen bonding between hardwood and softwood lignin and the observed differences in the glass transition temperature.},

  Year = {2020},
  Abstract = {Peatlands accumulate organic matter (OM) under anaerobic conditions. After drainage for forestry or agriculture, microbial respiration and peat oxidation induce OM losses and change the stoichiometry of the remaining organic material. Here, we (i) evaluate whether land use (cropland CL, grassland GL, forest FL, natural peatland NL) is associated with different peat stoichiometry, (ii) study how peat stoichiometry changes with OM content and (iii) infer the fate of nitrogen upon soil degradation. Organic C and soil N were measured for 1310 samples from 48 sites in Switzerland, and H and O for 1165. The soil OM content and C/N ratio were most sensitive to land use and are hence best suited as indicators for peatland degradation. OM contents (CL {\textless} GL {\textless} FL {\textless} NL), H/C, O/C, C/N ratios, and OM oxidation states were significantly different between land use types in top- and subsoils. With decreasing bulk OM content, C was relatively depleted while H and particularly N were higher. The data suggest very high N mobilization rates from strongly decomposed peat in agricultural topsoil. A comparison to peat C and N from mostly intact peatlands of the Northern hemisphere reveals that agriculture and, to a lesser extent, forestry induce a progressed state of soil degradation.},

  Volume = {202},

  Abstract = {Depicted as large polymers by the traditional model, humic substances (HS) tend to be considered resistant to biodegradation. However, HS should be regarded as supramolecular associations of rather small molecules. There is evidence that they can be degraded not only by aerobic but also by anaerobic bacteria. HS presence alters biological transformations of organic pollutants in water and soil. HS, including humin, have a great potential for an application in aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment as well as in bioremediation. Black carbon materials, including char (biochar) and activated carbon (AC), long recognized effective sorbents, have been recently discovered to act as effective redox mediators (RM), which may significantly accelerate degradation of organic pollutants in a way similar to HS. Humic-like coating on the biochar surface has been identified. Explanation of mechanisms and possibility of applications of black carbon materials have only started to be explored. Results of many original and review papers, presented and discussed in this article, show an enormous potential for an interesting, multidisciplinary research as well as for a development of new, green technologies for biological wastewater treatment and bioremediation. Future research areas have been suggested.},

  Volume = {684},
  Year = {2019},
  Abstract = {Peat carbon accumulation is controlled by both large scale factors, such as climate and hydrological setting, and small scale factors, such as microtopography and plant community. These small scale factors commonly vary within peatlands and can cause variation in biogeochemical traits and carbon accumulation within the same site. To understand these within-site variations, we investigated long term carbon accumulation, peat decomposition, biogeochemistry of pore water and plant macrofossils along a transect in an ombrotrophic bog in southern Patagonia. An additional question we addressed is how historical deposition of volcanic ash on the peatland has affected its carbon balance. Variability in plant community and water table led to differences in long term peat and carbon accumulation (peat moss {\textgreater} cushion plant), organic matter decomposition (cushion plant {\textgreater} peat moss), and methane production (peat moss {\textgreater} cushion plant). Macrofossil analysis and radiocarbon dating indicated a relationship between plant community and carbon accumulation or decomposition during the historical succession of vegetation in the peatland. C/N ratio and isotopic signatures reflected variability in plant community as litter source, and DOC concentrations were controlled by humification level. Volcanic ash deposition had only limited effect on plant composition, but it was associated with increased decomposition in overlying peat layers. This study highlights the importance of understanding how plant communities develop, as changes in communities could significantly affect the potential of ombrotrophic peatlands as C sink.},

  Title = {{Characterization and quantification of reversible redox sites in humic substances}},
  Volume = {41},
  Year = {2007},
  Abstract = {Cyclic oxidation and reduction reactions using oxygen and palladium with H2, respectively, of dissolved humic and fulvic acids (HA and FA) and model quinone compounds were used to structurally characterize and quantify the electron-carrying capacity (ECC) of reversible redox sites present in humic substances. This technique was used to examine 8 quinone compounds and 14 HA and FA samples and identified 3 redox sites as a function of their stability against the Pd-catalyzed hydrogenolysis process. Six highly aliphatic HA and FA isolated from landfill leachate did not contain redox sites under any conditions; however, the other HA and FA demonstrated reversible redox properties characterized by a combination of three redox sites. On the basis of the model compound results, it is proposed that one site consists of a non-quinone structure (NQ) and the other two sites have quinone structures. The two quinone sites differ in that one group (Q1) has electron-withdrawing groups adjacent to the quinone functional group while the second group (Q2) contains either no substituents near the quinone or has nearby electron-donating groups with additional substitutents hindering hydrogenolysis through steric interactions. The reversible ECC of NQ sites ranged from 25 to 265 microequiv e- transferred/g HA or FA, representing 21-56{\%} of the total ECC of the HA and FA when measured with the mildest reducing method (pH 8.0, pure Pd). Q1 redox sites resistant to hydrogenolysis at pH 8.0 using Pd/Al2O3 accounted for 13-58{\%} of the total ECC and ranged from 40 to 120 microequiv e-/ g HA or FA. The most sensitive O2 reversible redox sites accounted for 8-50{\%} of the total ECC (20-220 microequiv e-/ g HA or FA). These results directly demonstrate that HA and FA are capable of acting as reversible electron-transfer agents using different functional groups, some of which may not be quinones.},

Dichroic infrared spectra of fibers placed in a custom-built microfluidic cuvette were acquired in air, in liquid (heavy) water, and in liquid dimethylacetamide using a novel combination of synchrotron-based Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy with polarization modulation. Differences were observed in the O-H stretching frequency region of the spruce spectra upon changing the ambient conditions. Analysis of these spectral variations provides information on hydrogen bonding, orientation, and accessibility of structural units of the wood polymers in the spruce cell walls. Our in situ approach contributes to a further understanding of the structural details of wood polymers in their native setting.},

  Volume = {51},
  Year = {2017},
  Abstract = {The electron transfer capacities (ETCs) of soil humic substances (HSs) are linked to the type and abundance of redox-active functional moieties in their structure. Natural temperature can affect the chemical structure of natural organic matter by regulating their oxidative transformation and degradation in soil. However, it is unclear if there is a direct correlation between ETC of soil HS and mean annual temperature. In this study, we assess the response of the electron-accepting and -donating capacities (EAC and EDC) of soil HSs to temperature by analyzing HSs extracted from soil set along glacial-interglacial cycles through loess-palaeosol sequences and along natural temperature gradients through latitude and altitude transects. We show that the EAC and EDC of soil HSs increase and decrease, respectively, with increasing temperature. Increased temperature facilitates the prevalence of oxidative degradation and transformation of HS in soils, thus potentially promoting the preferentially oxidative degradation of phenol moieties of HS or the oxidative transformation of electron-donating phenol moieties to electron-accepting quinone moieties in the HS structure. Consequently, the EAC and EDC of HSs in soil increase and decrease, respectively. The results of this study could help to understand biogeochemical processes, wherein the redox functionality of soil organic matter is involved in the context of increasing temperature.},

To also get the final reference list, run analysis/paper/007-latex.Rmd afterwards. Running the whole script takes about two hours and occupies additional disk space of $\backslash$textasciitilde 11 Gb. Alternatively, the Dockerfile can be used to build a Docker image from which all analyses can be reproduced. The Dockerfile ensures that all required dependencies are installed (e.g. specific R packages; this is managed using the R package renv). The Dockerfile provides instructions how to build a Docker image from the Dockerfile and how to run the image in a Docker container. It occupies disk space of $\backslash$textasciitilde 7 Gb. When the Docker image runs in a container, go to localhost:8787 in your Browser. You will find an RStudio interface where you can log in with username rstudio and password redoxpeat. Here you can find the Rmarkdown scripts (redoxpeat/analysis/paper/001-paper-main.rmd and analysis/paper/007-latex.Rmd) as described above.

  Volume = {130},
  Year = {2016},
  Abstract = {The formation and turnover of soil organic matter (SOM) includes the biogeochemical processing of the macronutrient elements nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulphur (S), which alters their stoichiometric relationships to carbon (C) and to each other. We sought patterns among soil organic C, N, P and S in data for c. 2000 globally distributed soil samples, covering all soil horizons. For non-peat soils, strong negative correlations (p~{\textless}~0.001) were found between N:C, P:C and S:C ratios and {\%} organic carbon (OC), showing that SOM of soils with low OC concentrations (high in mineral matter) is rich in N, P and S. The results can be described approximately with a simple mixing model in which nutrient-poor SOM (NPSOM) has N:C, P:C and S:C ratios of 0.039, 0.0011 and 0.0054, while nutrient-rich SOM (NRSOM) has corresponding ratios of 0.12, 0.016 and 0.016, so that P is especially enriched in NRSOM compared to NPSOM. The trends hold across a range of ecosystems, for topsoils, including O horizons, and subsoils, and across different soil classes. The major exception is that tropical soils tend to have low P:C ratios especially at low N:C. We suggest that NRSOM comprises compounds selected by their strong adsorption to mineral matter. The stoichiometric patterns established here offer a new quantitative framework for SOM classification and characterisation, and provide important constraints to dynamic soil and ecosystem models of carbon turnover and nutrient dynamics.},

  Title = {{Reversible redox chemistry of quinones: impact on biogeochemical cycles}},
  Volume = {77},
  Year = {2009},
  Abstract = {The role of quinone biomolecules and quinone moieties of natural organic matter (NOM) as the electron transfer mediator in essential biogeochemical processes such as iron bioreduction and contaminant degradation has received considerable interests in the past decade. Hypothesized electron shuttling mechanism must be evaluated based on the availability and stability of quinones under a given environmental setting. The goal of this review is to examine the source, reactivity, and fate of potential quinone catalysts with respect to chemical interactions (e.g., with other quinones and nucleophiles) that will inevitably occur in complex environmental media. We will first discuss natural and anthropogenic sources of quinones in aqueous environments, and fundamental transformation pathways including cross reaction, autoxidation, and addition reactions. We will then assess how the described sources (molecular structure) and transformation pathways (stability) will impact the ability of a quinone molecule to catalyze a biogeochemical process. Thermodynamics and kinetics of electron transfer reactions with both the electron donor (e.g., hydrogen sulfide as a bulk reductant) and the terminal electron acceptor (e.g., nitroaromatic explosives in contaminant degradation), and stability towards irreversible side reactions are the key factors determining the geochemical conditions under which the catalysis by a quinone molecule will be operative.},

  Volume = {52},
  Year = {2018},
  Abstract = {Electron-donating phenolic and electron-accepting quinone moieties in peat dissolved organic matter (DOM) are considered to play key roles in processes defining carbon cycling in northern peatlands. This work advances a flow-injection analysis system coupled to chronoamperometric detection to allow for the simultaneous and highly sensitive determination of these moieties in dilute DOM samples. Analysis of anoxic pore water and oxic pool water samples collected across an ombrotrophic bog in Sweden demonstrated the presence of both phenolic and quinone moieties in peat DOM. The pore water DOM had higher quantities of phenolic but not quinone moieties compared with commonly used model aquatic and terrestrial DOM isolates. Significantly lower phenol content in DOM from oxic pools than DOM from anoxic pore waters indicated oxidative DOM processing in the pools. Consistently, treatment of peat DOM with laccase, a phenol-oxidase, under oxic conditions resulted in an irreversible removal of phenols and reversible oxidation of hydroquinones to quinones. Electron transfer to peat DOM was fully reversible over an electrochemical reduction and subsequent O2-reoxidation cycle, supporting that quinones in peat DOM serve as regenerable microbial electron acceptors in peatlands. The results advance our understanding of redox processes involving phenolic and quinone DOM moieties and their roles in northern peatland carbon cycling.},

  Title = {{Oxidation of Reduced Peat Particulate Organic Matter by Dissolved Oxygen: Quantification of Apparent Rate Constants in the Field}},
  Volume = {52},
  Year = {2018},
  Abstract = {Peat particulate organic matter (POM) is an important terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration in northern peatlands provided that the electron-accepting capacity of POM is periodically restored by oxidation with O2 during peat oxygenation events. We employed push-pull tests with dissolved O2 as reactant to determine pseudo-first-order rate constants of O2 consumption ( kobs) in anoxic peat soil of an unperturbed Swedish ombrotrophic bog. Dissolved O2 was rapidly consumed in anoxic peat with a mean kobs of 2.91 $\pm$ 0.60 h-1, corresponding to an O2 half-life of $\sim$14 min. POM dominated O2 consumption, as evidenced from approximately 50-fold smaller kobs in POM-free control tests. Inhibiting microbial activity with formaldehyde did not appreciably slow O2 consumption, supporting abiotic O2 reduction by POM moieties, not aerobic respiration, as the primary route of O2 consumption. Peat preoxygenation with dissolved O2 lowered kobs in subsequent oxygen consumption tests, consistent with depletion of reduced moieties in POM. Finally, repeated oxygen consumption tests demonstrated that anoxic peat POM has a high reduction capacity, in excess to 20 \textgreek{m}mol electrons donated per gram POM. This work demonstrates rapid abiotic oxidation of reduced POM by O2, supporting that short-term oxygenation events can restore the capacity of POM to accept electrons from anaerobic respiration in temporarily anoxic parts of peatlands.},
