  abstract =      {The majority of northern peatlands were initiated
                   during the Holocene. Owing to their mass imbalance,
                   they have sequestered huge amounts of carbon in
                   terrestrial ecosystems. Although recent syntheses
                   have filled some knowledge gaps, the extent and
                   remoteness of many peatlands pose challenges to
                   developing reliable regional carbon accumulation
                   estimates from observations. In this work, we
                   employed an individual- and patch-based dynamic
                   global vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS) with peatland and
                   permafrost functionality to quantify long-term carbon
                   accumulation rates in northern peatlands and to
                   assess the effects of historical and projected future
                   climate change on peatland carbon balance. We
                   combined published datasets of peat basal age to form
                   an up-to-date peat inception surface for the
                   pan-Arctic region which we then used to constrain the
                   model. We divided our analysis into two parts, with a
                   focus both on the carbon accumulation changes
                   detected within the observed peatland boundary and at
                   pan-Arctic scale under two contrasting warming
                   scenarios (representative concentration
                   pathway-RCP8.5 and RCP2.6). We found that peatlands
                   continue to act as carbon sinks under both warming
                   scenarios, but their sink capacity will be
                   substantially reduced under the high-warming (RCP8.5)
                   scenario after 2050. Areas where peat production was
                   initially hampered by permafrost and low productivity
                   were found to accumulate more carbon because of the
                   initial warming and moisture-rich environment due to
                   permafrost thaw, higher precipitation and elevated
                   CO2 levels. On the other hand, we project that areas
                   which will experience reduced precipitation rates and
                   those without permafrost will lose more carbon in the
                   near future, particularly peatlands located in the
                   European region and between 45 and 55°N latitude.
                   Overall, we found that rapid global warming could
                   reduce the carbon sink capacity of the northern
                   peatlands in the coming decades.},

                   carbon, which could act as a positive feedback to
                   global climate change due to enhanced respiration
                   rates with warming. We have used a terrestrial
                   ecosystem model that includes permafrost carbon
                   dynamics, inhibition of respiration in frozen soil
                   layers, vertical mixing of soil carbon from surface
                   to permafrost layers, and CH(4) emissions from
                   flooded areas, and which better matches new
                   circumpolar inventories of soil carbon stocks, to
                   explore the potential for carbon-climate feedbacks at
                   high latitudes. Contrary to model results for the
                   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth
                   Assessment Report (IPCC AR4), when permafrost
                   processes are included, terrestrial ecosystems north
                   of 60°N could shift from being a sink to a source of
                   CO(2) by the end of the 21st century when forced by a
                   Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2
                   climate change scenario. Between 1860 and 2100, the
                   model response to combined CO(2) fertilization and
                   climate change changes from a sink of 68 Pg to a 27 +
                   -7 Pg sink to 4 + -18 Pg source, depending on the
                   processes and parameter values used. The integrated
                   change in carbon due to climate change shifts from
                   near zero, which is within the range of previous
                   model estimates, to a climate-induced loss of carbon
                   by ecosystems in the range of 25 + -3 to 85 + -16 Pg
                   C, depending on processes included in the model, with
                   a best estimate of a 62 + -7 Pg C loss. Methane
                   emissions from high-latitude regions are calculated

                   with increases due to CO(2) fertilization, permafrost
                   thaw, and warming-induced increased CH(4) flux
                   densities partially offset by a reduction in wetland

                   affects the ratio of CO2 to CH4 formation under
                   water-logged anoxic conditions in these systems.
                   Although the importance of peat organic matter as an
                   electron acceptor is increasingly recognized, the
                   actual budgets of electron accepting capacities of
                   dissolved and particulate organic matter remain
                   poorly characterized. To address this research need,
                   we incubated three different peat materials and
                   linked changes in the electron accepting capacities
                   (EAC) of peat organic matter (OM), including
                   dissolved and particulate organic matter, to the
                   observed CO2 and CH4 formation. Under anaerobic
                   conditions, EACOM decreased inverse to
                   non-methanogenic CO2 formation. Only after utilizable
                   EACOM was depleted did strictly methanogenic
                   conditions evolve with equimolar CH4 and CO2
                   formation rates, as theoretically expected. The
                   reduction of OM and the resultant decrease in EACOM
                   explained between 26 and 56{\%} of the
                   non-methanogenic CO2, which was between 5 and 39{\%}
                   of total CO2 produced. Compared to EACPOM, EACDOM
                   remained constant and may have served as a mediator
                   in electron transfer to the POM. In summary, our
                   study quantitatively demonstrated the important role
                   of peat OM as terminal electron acceptor for
                   anaerobic respiration in organic soils.},

                   in northern peatlands provided that the
                   electron-accepting capacity of POM is periodically
                   restored by oxidation with O2 during peat oxygenation
                   events. We employed push-pull tests with dissolved O2
                   as reactant to determine pseudo-first-order rate
                   constants of O2 consumption ( kobs) in anoxic peat
                   soil of an unperturbed Swedish ombrotrophic bog.
                   Dissolved O2 was rapidly consumed in anoxic peat with
                   a mean kobs of 2.91 $\pm$ 0.60 h-1, corresponding to
                   an O2 half-life of $\sim$14 min. POM dominated O2
                   consumption, as evidenced from approximately 50-fold
                   smaller kobs in POM-free control tests. Inhibiting
                   microbial activity with formaldehyde did not
                   appreciably slow O2 consumption, supporting abiotic
                   O2 reduction by POM moieties, not aerobic
                   respiration, as the primary route of O2 consumption.
                   Peat preoxygenation with dissolved O2 lowered kobs in
                   subsequent oxygen consumption tests, consistent with
                   depletion of reduced moieties in POM. Finally,
                   repeated oxygen consumption tests demonstrated that
                   anoxic peat POM has a high reduction capacity, in
                   excess to 20 \textgreek{m}mol electrons donated per
                   gram POM. This work demonstrates rapid abiotic
                   oxidation of reduced POM by O2, supporting that
                   short-term oxygenation events can restore the

                   and palladium with H2, respectively, of dissolved
                   humic and fulvic acids (HA and FA) and model quinone
                   compounds were used to structurally characterize and
                   quantify the electron-carrying capacity (ECC) of
                   reversible redox sites present in humic substances.
                   This technique was used to examine 8 quinone
                   compounds and 14 HA and FA samples and identified 3
                   redox sites as a function of their stability against
                   the Pd-catalyzed hydrogenolysis process. Six highly
                   aliphatic HA and FA isolated from landfill leachate
                   did not contain redox sites under any conditions;
                   however, the other HA and FA demonstrated reversible
                   redox properties characterized by a combination of
                   three redox sites. On the basis of the model compound
                   results, it is proposed that one site consists of a
                   non-quinone structure (NQ) and the other two sites
                   have quinone structures. The two quinone sites differ
                   in that one group (Q1) has electron-withdrawing
                   groups adjacent to the quinone functional group while
                   the second group (Q2) contains either no substituents
                   near the quinone or has nearby electron-donating
                   groups with additional substitutents hindering
                   hydrogenolysis through steric interactions. The
                   reversible ECC of NQ sites ranged from 25 to 265
                   microequiv e- transferred/g HA or FA, representing
                   21-56{\%} of the total ECC of the HA and FA when
                   measured with the mildest reducing method (pH 8.0,
                   pure Pd). Q1 redox sites resistant to hydrogenolysis
                   at pH 8.0 using Pd/Al2O3 accounted for 13-58{\%} of
                   the total ECC and ranged from 40 to 120 microequiv
                   e-/ g HA or FA. The most sensitive O2 reversible
                   redox sites accounted for 8-50{\%} of the total ECC
                   (20-220 microequiv e-/ g HA or FA). These results
                   directly demonstrate that HA and FA are capable of
                   acting as reversible electron-transfer agents using
                   different functional groups, some of which may not be
                   quinones.},

                   direct electrochemical reduction (DER) on glassy
                   carbon working electrodes (WE) and mediated
                   electrochemical reduction (MER) and oxidation (MEO)
                   using organic radicals to facilitate electron
                   transfer between HS and the WE. DER allows for
                   continuous monitoring of electron and proton transfer
                   to HS by chronocoulometry and automated acid
                   titration, respectively, and of changes in bulk HS
                   redox potential E(h). Leonardite Humic Acid (LHA)
                   showed an H(+)/e(-) ratio of unity and a decrease in
                   potential from E(h) = +0.18 to -0.23 V upon transfer
                   of 822 mumol(e-) g(LHA)(-1) at pH 7, consistent with
                   quinones as major redox-active functional moieties in
                   LHA. MER and MEO quantitatively detected electrons in
                   LHA samples that were prereduced by DER to different
                   extents. MER and MEO therefore accurately quantify
                   the redox state of HS. Cyclic DER and
                   O(2)-reoxidation revealed that electron transfer to
                   LHA was largely reversible. However, LHA contained a
                   small pool of moieties that were not reoxidized,
                   likely due to endergonic first electron transfer to
                   O(2). Electron accepting capacities of 13 different
                   HS, determined by MER, strongly correlated with their
                   C/H ratios and aromaticities and with previously
                   published values, which, however, were a factor of 3
                   smaller due to methodological limitations.},

                   organic macromolecules. While electron transfer to
                   and from HS under reducing conditions is well
                   investigated, comparatively little is known on the
                   electron donating (i.e., antioxidant) properties of
                   HS under oxic conditions. In this work, the electron
                   donating capacities (EDCs) of terrestrial and aquatic
                   HS were quantified by mediated electrochemical
                   oxidation over a wide range of pH values and applied
                   redox potentials (E(h)) using
                   2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)
                   as an electron transfer mediator. Electrochemical
                   oxidation of three model humic acids (HAs) was
                   largely irreversible, and the EDCs of these HAs
                   increased with increasing E(h) and pH. These results
                   suggest that HS contain a wide variety of moieties
                   that are oxidized at different potentials and that,
                   upon oxidation, release protons and undergo
                   irreversible follow-up reactions. At a given pH and
                   E(h), the EDCs of the HS correlated well with their
                   titrated phenol contents suggesting phenolic moieties
                   as major electron donating groups in HS. Comparing
                   the EDCs of 15 HS with their electron accepting
                   capacities (EACs), aquatic HS had higher EDCs and
                   lower EACs than terrestrial HS of comparable
                   aromaticities. These results indicate that oxidative
                   transformation of HS in the environment results in a
                   depletion of electron donating phenolic moieties with
                   antioxidant properties relative to the electron
                   accepting quinone moieties.},

                   regulating their oxidative transformation and

                   capacities (EAC and EDC) of soil HSs to temperature

                   temperature facilitates the prevalence of oxidative
                   degradation and transformation of HS in soils, thus
                   potentially promoting the preferentially oxidative
                   degradation of phenol moieties of HS or the oxidative

                   demonstrated the presence of both phenolic and

                   becoming an important tool in the study of natural
                   organic matter (NOM) at the molecular level.
                   Ultrahigh-resolution ESI-MS analyses of NOM often
                   produce very complicated spectra; therefore, visual
                   presentation and structural interpretations of the
                   spectra are difficult. To meet this analytical
                   challenge, we herein propose and demonstrate an
                   approach using the van Krevelen diagram. With this
                   approach, complicated mass spectra can be visualized
                   in a way that allows for (1) possible reaction
                   pathways to be identified and presented, and (2)
                   qualitative analyses on major classes of compounds
                   that comprise ultrahigh-resolution spectra. The
                   qualitative analyses are in a good agreement with
                   results obtained from analyses by other analytical
                   techniques. Additionally, the van Krevelen diagram
                   can be expanded to a 3D plot by using peak
                   intensities or relative intensities as the z-axis.
                   The 3D van Krevelen diagram allows for an evaluation
                   of the relative significance of structurally related
                   compounds. The 3D plot can also be a useful tool for
                   compositional differentiation among samples.},

                   induce OM losses and change the stoichiometry of the

                   changes with OM content and (iii) infer the fate of
                   nitrogen upon soil degradation. Organic C and soil N
                   were measured for 1310 samples from 48 sites in
                   Switzerland, and H and O for 1165. The soil OM
                   content and C/N ratio were most sensitive to land use
                   and are hence best suited as indicators for peatland
                   degradation. OM contents
  (CL {\textless} GL {\textless} FL {\textless} NL), H/C, O/C, C/N
  ratios, and OM oxidation states were significantly different between land use
  types in top- and subsoils. With decreasing bulk OM content, C was relatively
  depleted while H and particularly N were higher. The data suggest very high N
  mobilization rates from strongly decomposed peat in agricultural topsoil. A
  comparison to peat C and N from mostly intact peatlands of the Northern
  hemisphere reveals that agriculture and, to a lesser extent, forestry induce
  a progressed state of soil degradation.},

                   Given that most peat accumulates in boreal regions,
                   where low temperatures and water saturation preserve
                   organic matter, the existence of peat in
                   (sub)tropical regions remains enigmatic. Here we
                   examined peat and plant chemistry across a
                   latitudinal transect from the Arctic to the tropics.
                   Near-surface low-latitude peat has lower carbohydrate
                   and greater aromatic content than near-surface
                   high-latitude peat, creating a reduced oxidation
                   state and resulting recalcitrance. This recalcitrance
                   allows peat to persist in the (sub)tropics despite
                   warm temperatures. Because we observed similar
                   declines in carbohydrate content with depth in
                   high-latitude peat, our data explain recent
                   field-scale deep peat warming experiments in which
                   catotelm (deeper) peat remained stable despite
                   temperature increases up to 9 °C. We suggest that
                   high-latitude deep peat reservoirs may be stabilized
                   in the face of climate change by their ultimately
                   lower carbohydrate and higher aromatic composition,
                   similar to tropical peats.},

  abstract =      {Peat carbon accumulation is controlled by both large
                   scale factors, such as climate and hydrological
                   setting, and small scale factors, such as
                   microtopography and plant community. These small
                   scale factors commonly vary within peatlands and can
                   cause variation in biogeochemical traits and carbon
                   accumulation within the same site. To understand
                   these within-site variations, we investigated long
                   term carbon accumulation, peat decomposition,
                   biogeochemistry of pore water and plant macrofossils
                   along a transect in an ombrotrophic bog in southern
                   Patagonia. An additional question we addressed is how
                   historical deposition of volcanic ash on the peatland
                   has affected its carbon balance. Variability in plant
                   community and water table led to differences in long
                   term peat and carbon accumulation (peat
                   moss {\textgreater} cushion plant), organic
                   matter decomposition (cushion
                   plant {\textgreater} peat moss), and methane
                   production (peat moss {\textgreater} cushion
                   plant). Macrofossil analysis and radiocarbon dating
                   indicated a relationship between plant community and
                   carbon accumulation or decomposition during the
                   historical succession of vegetation in the peatland.
                   C/N ratio and isotopic signatures reflected
                   variability in plant community as litter source, and
                   DOC concentrations were controlled by humification
                   level. Volcanic ash deposition had only limited
                   effect on plant composition, but it was associated
                   with increased decomposition in overlying peat
                   layers. This study highlights the importance of
                   understanding how plant communities develop, as
                   changes in communities could significantly affect the
                   potential of ombrotrophic peatlands as C sink.},

                   and pollutant redox reactions. The objective of this
                   work was to characterize the proton and electron
                   transfer equilibria of the reducible moieties in
                   different humic acids (HA). Cyclic voltammetry
                   experiments demonstrated that diquat and
                   ethylviologen mediated electron transfer between
                   carbon working electrodes and HA. These compounds
                   were used also to facilitate attainment of redox
                   equilibria between redox electrodes and HA in
                   potentiometric E(h) measurements. Bulk electrolysis
                   of HA combined with pH-stat acid titration
                   demonstrated that electron transfer to the reducible
                   moieties in HA also resulted in proton uptake,
                   suggesting decreasing reduction potentials E(h) of HA
                   with increasing pH. This was confirmed by
                   potentiometric E(h)-pH titrations of HA at different
                   redox states. E(h) measurements of HA samples
                   prereduced to different redox states by bulk
                   electrolysis revealed reducible moieties in HA that
                   cover a wide range of apparent standard reduction
                   potentials at pH 7 from E(h)(0)* = +0.15 to -0.3 V.
                   Modeling revealed an overall increase in the relative
                   abundance of reducible moieties with decreasing E(h).
                   The wide range of HA is consistent with its
                   involvement in numerous environmental electron
                   transfer reactions under various redox conditions.},

                   as percentage of total fatty acids, and technological
                   properties, such as fresh cheese yield and protein
                   recovery, using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)
                   spectral data. Our main hypothesis was that Bayesian
                   models that can estimate shrinkage and perform
                   variable selection may improve our ability to predict
                   FA traits and technological traits above and beyond
                   what can be achieved using the current calibration
                   models (e.g., partial least squares, PLS). To this
                   end, we assessed a series of Bayesian methods and
                   compared their prediction performance with that of
                   PLS. The comparison between models was done using the
                   same sets of data (i.e., same samples, same
                   variability, same spectral treatment) for each trait.
                   Data consisted of 1,264 individual milk samples
                   collected from Brown Swiss cows for which gas
                   chromatographic FA composition, milk coagulation
                   properties, and cheese-yield traits were available.
                   For each sample, 2 spectra in the infrared region
                   from 5,011 to 925 cm(-1) were available and averaged
                   before data analysis. Three Bayesian models: Bayesian
                   ridge regression (Bayes RR), Bayes A, and Bayes B,
                   and 2 reference models: PLS and modified PLS (MPLS)
                   procedures, were used to calibrate equations for each
                   of the traits. The Bayesian models used were
                   implemented in the R package BGLR
  (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BGLR/index.html), whereas the PLS and
  MPLS were those implemented in the WinISI II software (Infrasoft
  International LLC, State College, PA). Prediction accuracy was estimated for
  each trait and model using 25 replicates of a training-testing validation
  procedure. Compared with PLS, which is currently the most widely used
  calibration method, MPLS and the 3 Bayesian methods showed significantly
  greater prediction accuracy. Accuracy increased in moving from calibration to
  external validation methods, and in moving from PLS and MPLS to Bayesian
  methods, particularly Bayes A and Bayes B. The maximum R(2) value of
  validation was obtained with Bayes B and Bayes A. For the FA, C10:0 ({\%} of
  each FA on total FA basis) had the highest R(2) (0.75, achieved with Bayes A
  and Bayes B), and among the technological traits, fresh cheese yield R(2) of
  0.82 (achieved with Bayes B). These 2 methods have proven to be useful
  instruments in shrinking and selecting very informative wavelengths and
  inferring the structure and functions of the analyzed traits. We conclude
  that Bayesian models are powerful tools for deriving calibration equations,
  and, importantly, these equations can be easily developed using existing
  open-source software. As part of our study, we provide scripts based on the
  open source R software BGLR, which can be used to train customized prediction
  equations for other traits or populations.},

                   and sulphur (S), which alters their stoichiometric

                   covering all soil horizons. For non-peat soils,
                   strong negative correlations (p~{\textless}~0.001)
                   were found between N:C, P:C and S:C ratios and {\%}
                   organic carbon (OC), showing that SOM of soils with
                   low OC concentrations (high in mineral matter) is
                   rich in N, P and S. The results can be described
                   approximately with a simple mixing model in which
                   nutrient-poor SOM (NPSOM) has N:C, P:C and S:C ratios
                   of 0.039, 0.0011 and 0.0054, while nutrient-rich SOM

                   0.016, so that P is especially enriched in NRSOM
                   compared to NPSOM. The trends hold across a range of

                   subsoils, and across different soil classes. The
                   major exception is that tropical soils tend to have
                   low P:C ratios especially at low N:C. We suggest that
                   NRSOM comprises compounds selected by their strong
                   adsorption to mineral matter. The stoichiometric
                   patterns established here offer a new quantitative
                   framework for SOM classification and

                   cytotoxic/genotoxic and/or chemopreventive effects of
                   several phenolic botanical extracts. For example,

                   contains catechins which are directly oxidized to
                   o-quinones by various oxidative enzymes.
                   Alternatively, phenolic botanicals could be
                   o-hydroxylated by P450 to form catechols in vivo
                   which are oxidized to o-quinones. Examples include,
                   resveratrol which is oxidized to piceatannol and

                   o-quinones can be formed by O-dealkylation of
                   O-alkoxy groups or methylenedioxy rings resulting in
                   catechols which are further oxidized to o-quinones.
                   Examples include safrole, eugenol, podophyllotoxin
                   and etoposide, as well as methysticin. Once formed
                   these o-quinones have a variety of biological targets
                   in vivo resulting in various biological effects
                   ranging from chemoprevention -{\textgreater} no
                   effect -{\textgreater} toxicity. This U-shaped
                   biological effect curve has been described for a
                   number of reactive intermediates including
                   o-quinones. The current review summarizes the latest
                   data on the formation and biological targets of
                   botanical o-quinones.},

                   of living and dead biomass in bogs. These plants
                   contain peculiar polyphenols which hamper litter peat
                   decomposition through their inhibitory activity on
                   microbial breakdown. In the light of the increasing
                   availability of biologically active nitrogen in
                   natural ecosystems, litter derived from Sphagnum
                   mosses is an ideal substrate to test the potential
                   effects of increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition
                   on polyphenol content in litter peat. To this aim, we
                   measured total nitrogen and soluble polyphenol
                   concentration in Sphagnum litter peat collected in 11
                   European bogs under a chronic gradient of atmospheric
                   nitrogen deposition. Our results demonstrate that
                   increasing nitrogen concentration in Sphagnum litter,
                   as a consequence of increased exogenous nitrogen
                   availability, is accompanied by a decreasing
                   concentration of polyphenols. This inverse
                   relationship is consistent with reports that in
                   Sphagnum mosses, polyphenol and protein biosynthesis
                   compete for the same precursor. Our observation of
                   modified Sphagnum litter chemistry under chronic
                   nitrogen eutrophication has implications in the
                   context of the global carbon balance, because a lower
                   content of decay-inhibiting polyphenols would
                   accelerate litter peat decomposition.},

                   recent increase in DOC (dissolved organic carbon) in
                   freshwater ecosystems. One suggested mechanism for
                   the enhanced decomposition of peat and the releases
                   of DOC is recovery from acidification. However, no
                   biological role in the process has yet been
                   identified. Here we report extracellular enzyme
                   activities and microbial composition in peatlands of
                   Korea, the UK, Japan and Indonesia, and find higher
                   pH to promote phenol oxidase activities, greater
                   abundances in Actinobacteria and fungi, and enhanced
                   pore-water DOC concentrations. Our pH manipulation
                   experiments also showed that increase in pH enhanced
                   phenol oxidase activity and DOC production with
                   greater Actinobacterial and fungal abundances.
                   Finally, knockout or addition of phenol oxidase
                   dramatically changed DOC and phenolic production,
                   indicating the central role of phenol oxidase in DOC
                   mobilisation. Our findings provide evidence to
                   support a previously unrecognized biological
                   mechanism through which pH increases activate phenol

                   thereby directly affecting global climate at multiple
                   scales, but how they do it is far from understood.
                   Here we show that manganese oxide (Mn oxide) in a
                   water treatment works filter bed traps dissolved OC
                   as coatings build up in layers around clean sand
                   grains at 3{\%}w/wC. Using spectroscopic and
                   thermogravimetric methods, we identify two main OC
                   fractions. One is thermally refractory
                   ({\textgreater}550 °C) and the other is thermally
                   more labile ({\textless}550 °C). We postulate that
                   the thermal stability of the trapped OC is due to
                   carboxylate groups within it bonding to Mn oxide
                   surfaces coupled with physical entrapment within the
                   layers. We identify a significant difference in the
                   nature of the surface-bound OC and bulk OC . We
                   speculate that polymerization reactions may be
                   occurring at depth within the layers. We also propose
                   that these processes must be considered in future
                   studies of OC in natural systems.},

                   Markov chains. Practical Bayesian data analysis, like

                   building, inference, model checking and evaluation,
                   and model expansion. Visualization is helpful in each
                   of these stages of the Bayesian workflow and it is
                   indispensable when drawing inferences from the types
                   of modern, high-dimensional models that are used by
                   applied researchers.},

                   This new edition to the classic book by ggplot2
                   creator Hadley Wickham highlights compatibility with
                   knitr and RStudio. ggplot2 is a data visualization
                   package for R that helps users create data graphics,
                   including those that are multi-layered, with ease.
                   With ggplot2, it's easy to: • produce handsome,
                   publication-quality plots with automatic legends
                   created from the plot specification • superimpose
                   multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box
                   plots) from different data sources with automatically
                   adjusted common scales • add customizable smoothers
                   that use powerful modeling capabilities of R, such as
                   loess, linear models, generalized additive models,
                   and robust regression • save any ggplot2 plot (or
                   part thereof) for later modification or reuse •
                   create custom themes that capture in-house or journal
                   style requirements and that can easily be applied to
                   multiple plots • approach a graph from a visual
                   perspective, thinking about how each component of the
                   data is represented on the final plot This book will
                   be useful to everyone who has struggled with
                   displaying data in an informative and attractive way.
                   Some basic knowledge of R is necessary (e.g.,
                   importing data into R). ggplot2 is a mini-language
                   specifically tailored for producing graphics, and
                   you'll learn everything you need in the book. After
                   reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics
                   customized precisely for your problems, and you'll
                   find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on
                   to the screen or page. New to this
                   edition:{\textless} • Brings the book up-to-date
                   with ggplot2 1.0, including major updates to the
                   theme system • New scales, stats and geoms added
                   throughout • Additional practice exercises • A
                   revised introduction that focuses on ggplot() instead
                   of qplot() • Updated chapters on data and modeling
                   using tidyr, dplyr and broom},
